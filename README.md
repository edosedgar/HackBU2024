# SecretGPT: hiding messages on social media

## Motivation

With the widespread use of social media and the adoption of generative AI technologies like ChatGPT, an intriguing opportunity for covert communication arises. Our project serves two purposes. First, SecretGPT is a proof of concept for concealing secret messages within innocent looking text generated by AI. Second, our project functions as a security audit, shedding light on the potential misuse of publicly available large language models (with publicly available APIs) by bad actors.

It is an ethical question whether large corporations like Google or the Government should store copies of users' encryption keys for public safety. In terms of detecting secret communication, it easy to tell if someone uses cryptography; the message will be a garbled string of characters. However, the method we demonstrate for secret communication (called steganography) allows the sender to hide the fact that secret communication is even occurring. In particular, the use of generative AI to do steganography by synthesizing text poses a potential threat to national security.

The project was done at [HackBU 2024 hackathon]() within 24 hours.
